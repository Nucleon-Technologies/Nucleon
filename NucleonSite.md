# Nucleon
You can get the script here : 
```LUA
getgenv().NCLKey = nil

loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nucleon-Technologies/Zyllus-Likes-E-Kittens/main/sex.lua", true))()
```



## Supported executors
### Why you need a good executor?
You need a good quality executor for Nucleon's needs. Without a good executor, Roblox might crash or Nucleon will get an error. If it does get an error its because your executor doesnt have the required `Lua` Functions expected by Nucleon.

We are trying our best to support **Oxygen U**

#### **Krnl**
- Krnl is supported by Nucleon, And a good quality executor to work with C:, Its basically a `free` alternitive of Synapse!, You can download it here : [Krnl](https://krnl.place)

#### **Synapse**
- Synapse is the **best** executor in the community, It can run all scripts, Its the best executor to work with, All though its `paid`, Its an amazing executor! You can download from here : [Synapse](https://x.synapse.to/)

#### **Script-Ware**
- Script-Ware is also one of the best. It almost has the same execution power as Synapse, It can run **99%** of all scripts, Synapse wins only because there are some 'Synapse Only Scripts'. Forgot to mention that it is `Paid`, You can download here : [Script-Ware](https://Script-Ware.com)
